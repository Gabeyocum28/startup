# OfficeHoursAI - Intelligent TA Assistant

[My Notes](notes.md)

OfficeHoursAI revolutionizes office hours by providing students with instant, intelligent tutoring assistance while helping teachers manage virtual office hours efficiently. Students can join virtual offices, upload course materials, and chat with an AI teaching assistant that understands their specific coursework in a way that incentivises learning, not simply giving answers.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

Imagine never waiting in long office hour lines again, while still getting personalized help with your coursework. OfficeHoursAI creates virtual office hours where students can instantly chat with an intelligent TA that has been trained on their specific course materials. Teachers upload their class materials such as their syllabus, lecture notes, and assignments, then share a simple join code with students. The AI provides immediate help to homework questions and explains concepts from uploaded materials. This AI would be trained to promote learning and focus on student development over quick answers. It's like having a teaching assistant available 24/7 who actually knows your specific class content.
