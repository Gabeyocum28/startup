# OfficeHoursAI - Intelligent TA Assistant

[My Notes](notes.md)

OfficeHoursAI revolutionizes office hours by providing students with instant, intelligent tutoring assistance while helping teachers manage virtual office hours efficiently. Students can join virtual offices, upload course materials, and chat with an AI teaching assistant that understands their specific coursework in a way that incentivises learning, not simply giving answers.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Imagine never waiting in long office hour lines again, while still getting personalized help with your coursework. OfficeHoursAI creates virtual office hours where students can instantly chat with an intelligent TA that has been trained on their specific course materials. Teachers upload their class materials such as their syllabus, lecture notes, and assignments, then share a simple join code with students. The AI provides immediate help to homework questions and explains concepts from uploaded materials. This AI would be trained to promote learning and focus on student development over quick answers. It's like having a teaching assistant available 24/7 who actually knows your specific class content.

### Design

![Application Wireframes](IMG_1695.JPG)

The application features a role-based interface with distinct experiences for teachers and students:

**Login/Registration Flow**: Secure authentication distinguishing between teacher and student accounts with encrypted password storage.

**Teacher Dashboard**: Comprehensive class management where teachers can create classes, upload course materials, monitor student interactions, and customize their AI assistant's behavior and knowledge base.

**Student Dashboard**: Simple interface showing enrolled classes with easy access to AI chat sessions and the ability to join new classes via teacher-provided codes.

**AI Chat Interface**: Interactive learning environment where students can chat with course-aware AI, take practice tests, get homework help, upload files for assistance, and receive personalized learning support that adapts to their individual needs.

- **Role-Based Authentication**: Secure login system distinguishing between teachers and students with encrypted credentials
- **Class Management**: Teachers create classes with unique join codes for easy student enrollment
- **Intelligent File Processing**: Teachers upload course materials (syllabi, notes, assignments) for AI context training
- **Adaptive AI Assistant**: AI that learns each student's preferences, knowledge level, and optimal learning style
- **Interactive Learning Tools**: Practice test generation, homework checking, and step-by-step problem solving assistance
- **Conversation Memory**: AI remembers past interactions to provide increasingly personalized help
- **File Upload Support**: Students can upload assignments or questions for AI analysis and feedback
- **Teacher Oversight**: Teachers can monitor AI interactions and customize assistant behavior for their specific course needs

### Technologies
